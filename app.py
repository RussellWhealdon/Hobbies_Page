Some of my favorite activies include playing basketball and recently pickleball in the park. I'm also part of the North Brooklyn Chess club where I play weekly as well as in some competive tournaments from time to time. I love to problem solve and Chess is a great way to scratch that urge for me! Recently I have started volunteer coaching youth basketball clinics through the VOLO foundation. I am hoping to start coaching my own team soon!</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
